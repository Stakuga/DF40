We have added the annotations for the facial attributes of each video in our dataset. Since we mainly use FF++ and Celeb-DF for creating fake videos and images, we use the tools proposed in [link](https://github.com/pterhoer/DeepFakeAnnotations) for annotations. Here, we have provided the annotations of FF++ and Celeb-DF with zip files. You can also access annotations of other datasets from the above link.

You can use the provided annotations for developing unbiased models and dealing with the fairness problem. Also, since most previous works also use FF++ and Celeb-DF for fairness research, these methods can still be applied in our dataset for further analysis.
